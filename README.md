# Hi, I’m Musa Aziz 👋

I’m a UK-based **Data Engineer** and **product builder** focused on turning ideas into real, usable software — especially products that work reliably in **emerging/third-world markets** where constraints (connectivity, payments, language, devices) matter.

---

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- **MotoBazaar** — a vehicle marketplace platform (private sellers + dealerships), built with a focus on real-world usability and multilingual support.
- Building repeatable **data engineering patterns**: ingestion, transformations, validation, and documentation.

---

## 🧠 What I care about
- **Practical engineering** over hype (shipping > theory)
- **Simple UX** that works on low-end devices and inconsistent internet
- **Localization & accessibility** (language support, culturally-aware design)
- Products that can scale from “small city” to “nationwide”

---

## 🧰 Tech I use
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Data:** Azure / Microsoft Fabric, Snowflake, Databricks, ADF, Power BI  
- **Product/Backend:** Supabase, Postgres  
- **Other:** Git, CI/CD, testing & validation workflows

---

## 📌 Featured projects
- **MotoBazaar** — vehicle marketplace for Afghanistan, bringing buyers and sellers together to trade with ease and trust.
